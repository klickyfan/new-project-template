# Contributing

**Thank you for your interest in this project. Your contributions are highly welcome.**

There are multiple ways of getting involved:

- [Report a bug](#report-a-bug) 
- [Suggest a feature](#suggest-a-feature) 
- [Alter/add code](#alter/add-code) 

Below are a few guidelines we would like you to follow.
If you need help, please reach out to us by opening an issue.

## Report a bug 

Reporting bugs is one of the best ways to contribute. Before creating a bug report, please check that an [issue](/issues) reporting the same problem does not already exist. If there is such an issue, you may add your information as a comment.

To report a new bug you should open an issue that summarizes the bug and set the label to "bug".

If you want to provide a fix along with your bug report: That is great! In this case please send us a pull request as described in section [Alter/add code](#alter/add-code).

## Suggest a feature

To request a new feature you should open an [issue](../../issues/new) and summarize the desired functionality and its use case. Set the issue label to "feature".  

## Alter/add code

Fork, then clone the repo. Make your changes, test, push to your fork and submit a pull request.

At this point you're waiting on us. We will try to get back to you within three business days and may suggest
some changes, improvements or alternatives.

Some things that will increase the chance that your pull request is accepted:

* Write tests.
* Follow [Microsoft's C# coding conventions].
* Write a [good commit message][commit].
