# New Project Template

This project contains all the files that any open source LevelUp/Grubhub project should have.

[See this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Asabrw9rv08w-dPYwjEZ2jesz_R34w6_DgYk5zFfEXM/edit#) for more information about how to release a new open source LevelUp project.

This template uses the Apache license, as that is LevelUp's default. 

## How to use this template

1. Clone this project and copy the files it contains into your own project.
2. Update the README.md as needed, keeping in mind that it is the first impression new users have of your project, and likely the most important piece of it's documentation.
3. Update the CONTRIBUTING.md as needed.
5. If in doubt, get in touch with opensource@levelup.com.
