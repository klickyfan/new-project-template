# New Project Template

This project contains all the files that any open source LevelUp/Grubhub project should have.

[See this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Asabrw9rv08w-dPYwjEZ2jesz_R34w6_DgYk5zFfEXM/edit#) for more information about how to release a new open source LevelUp/Grubhub project.

This template uses the Apache 2.0 license, as that is LevelUp/Grubhub's default. 

## How to use this template

1. Clone this project and copy the files it contains into your own project.
2. Replace this README.me with [this one](https://github.com/TheLevelUp/guides/blob/master/pos/library-README-template.md), updating it as needed while keeping in mind that it is the first impression new users have of your project, and likely the most important piece of it's documentation. 
3. Update the CONTRIBUTING.md as needed.
4. Update the SECURITY.md as needed.
5. If in doubt, get in touch with opensource@levelup.com.
